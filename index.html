      <p id="compare-p">
        Our comparative visualization tool is designed to offer a side-by-side analytical view of film industry metrics
        across different countries. By choosing two nations from the dropdown menus, users can effectively compare
        various elements,
        including genre popularity, budget allocations, release trends, and more. This interactive feature allows us to
        reveal commonalities
        and disparities in the cinematic approaches of each country. In the illustrative example below,
        we present trends from the United States and Japan. Our visualizations depict varying top genre preferences,
        with 'Drama'
        and 'Comedy' leading in the US, while 'Animation' and 'Action' take precedence in Japanâ€”a reflection of cultural
        distinctions in
        cinematic preferences. To explore further, use the dropdown menu located above each set of graphs to
        dynamically alter the
        displayed statistics by country.

      <h4 id="compare-header">Another Example - China and Italy - A Dive into Film and History</h4>
      <p id="compare-p">
        Some interesting insight is revealed when exploring the release date distributions of movies in China and Italy.
        The majority of Chinese movies in the dataset are concentrated in the 2000s and onwards, reflecting a notable
        surge in cinematic
        output during this period. This aligns with China's dynamic and rapidly growing film industry, marked by
        increased investments and
        global recognition in the 21st century. Conversely, Italy, while also showcasing a significant portion of movies
        from the 2000s onwards, shows
        a substantial presence of films dating back to the 1960s. The extensive timeline in Italy's cinematic history
        suggests the enduring significance
        of film in their culture over the decades, spanning diverse cinematic eras and styles. This contrast between
        China and
        Italy underscores the nuanced temporal patterns in film production across different regions, shedding light on
        the historical contexts that
        shape each country's cinematic narrative. Select 'China' and 'Italy' using the dropdown menus of this tool to
        view the comparison.

      <h1 id="compare-title">Genres Across Borders</h1>
      <p id="compare-p">
        In our next visualization, we will further uncover the intersection of film genres across countries. Our tool
        plots the count of movies per genre for countries around the world, enabling users to see the prevalence of a
        specified genre in movie production. This map visualization allows viewers to quickly find similarities and
        differences of the most popular genres in a geographical perspective. To dynamically update the visualization,
        select a genre from the dropdown menu. Click, hold, and drag to move the map view around, and hover over each
        point to view genre percentage (count of movies for a given genre divded by the total movies for that country).
      <h4 id="compare-header">NOTE: </h4>
      <p id="compare-p">
        Many of the orange and red points, indicating a high percentage, are movies with a low total movie count. It is
        important to consider the total movie count for a country to get a more realistic takeaway from the genre
        percentages. We recognize that although our dataset is extensive, it still has its limitations, and may not have
        high movie counts for all countries. A movie can have multiple genres and be counted once across different
        genres. Therefore the genre percentages may not all add up to 100%.

      <h4 id="compare-header-under">An Insightful Example: The Distribution of Action Movies Produced</h4>
      <p id="compare-p">
        In the visualization below, the map is updated with 'Action' as the selected genre. Looking at the plotted
        points, we can see the varying popularity of action movies by region. For example, most of the percentages in
        North America and Western Europe lie between 15-30%, which is lower than the percentages in Eastern Europe and
        Asia where the ranges mostly lie between 30-60%. Some notable high percentages are China (62%), Japan (53%), and
        Russia (51%) marking a significant contrast from the countries in North America, which range from 20-30%. It is
        possible that the distinct cultural tastes and preferences may drive the differnces in these percentages.
        Different regions often have unique storytelling traditions, historical influences, and societal preferences
        that shape the popularity of specific genres.
        <!-- <strong>Additional patterns to add to narrative: fantasy, animation, action more asian russian, heavy. On the other hand romance, comedy more heavily western countryes, USA Canada, france, uk, italy, etc. india and austrailia have a higher perctange family. Horro very common in northern europe, MENA/arabic nations, Austialia + NZ. War genre is heavy for Middle east / muslim and eastern europe</strong> -->
      </p>
      <h4 id="compare-header">Exploring Fantasy: Regional Preferences in Fantasy Movie Production</h4>
      <p id="compare-p">
        The map below highlights 'Fantasy' as the chosen genre. We observe distinct regional preferences for fantasy movies. For instance, East Asian countries and Russia show a pronounced affinity, with percentages generally ranging from 20-30%. Particularly, China (~21%), Russia (~22%), and Japan (~30%) showcase a strong inclination towards this genre. This contrast is stark when compared to Western countries like the United States, Canada, and the UK, where fantasy movie production constitutes about 10% of the total. The unique mythologies and folklore prevalent in Asian and Russian cultures could be influencing this trend.
      </p>

      <h4 id="compare-header">Comedy and Romance: Western Dominance in Lighter Genres</h4>
      <p id="compare-p">
        This section focuses on 'Comedy' and 'Romance' genres. The map illustrates that these genres are predominantly popular in Western countries. For instance, The United States, Canada, France, the UK, Italy, and other Western nations in Europe show a substantial production of these genres, with percentages often exceeding 15-40% respectively. This trend reflects the cultural leanings and social contexts of these regions, where light-hearted entertainment is highly valued. The influence of historical cinematic movements, such as the French New Wave and Hollywood's Golden Age, may also play a role in this trend.
      </p>

      <h4 id="compare-header">The Global Appeal of Horror: A Cross-Continental Analysis</h4>
      <p id="compare-p">
        In this visualization, we focus on the 'Horror' genre. It's intriguing to see its widespread appeal, with significant popularity in Northern Europe, MENA/Arabic nations, and regions like Australia and New Zealand. Countries like Sweden, Egypt, and New Zealand often see horror films making up to 30% of their cinematic output. This trend might be attributed to the diverse cultural narratives and folklore that lend themselves well to the horror genre. Additionally, war, lack of light may also lead to larger amount of horror movies being produced. </p>

     

      <h4 id="globe-header">A Global Distubriton of IMDb movies</h4>
      <p id="globe-desc">
        In our final and most interactive visualization, we illustrate the cinematic landscape on a globe, plotting the
        total movie counts for each respective country. Each country is represented by a colored dot, with the size of
        the dot representing the total movie count for that country. The circle's radius size is directly proportional
        to the total movie count, and the color becomes darker and more red as the movie count increases. Click, hold,
        and drag to rotate the globe. Hovering over each point will list the country's name and movie count. Beyond the
        movie metadata, users can explore specific movies for each country by clicking on a point. The popup that
        appears after clicking a point offers an interactive experience, enabling users to browse movie posters, titles,
        ratings, an overviews to immerse themselves in the diversity of cinema. We also incorporated a filtering
        feature, which allows users to tailor search results to their interests. Overall, our inteactive globe reveals
        cinematic contributions from around the world and provides an in-depth exploration of the movies behind the
        trends.
